# macutils

Macutils is a set of old tools for dealing with outdated Mac file formats from the 90s.

This is a fork of a [fork](https://github.com/wnayes/macutils), with the following changes:

* Fix 64-bit builds (CRC would break).
* Replace build system (hand coded make files) with a saner one (meson).
* Fix lots (but not all) of compiler warnings.
* Conversion to ANSI C.
